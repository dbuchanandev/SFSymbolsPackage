# SFSymbolsPackage

## Description
I wanted an easier way to access SF Symbols. I'm far from the first to do this, but it has some extra stuff I wanted.
All Symbols and Categories are listed here in the order in which they are presented in the macOS SF Symbols app Version 1.1 (16).

## Usage
You're going to have a better time with this if you use generic types that conform to the `SFSymbol` protocol.
```swift
struct ExampleSwiftUIView<S>: View where S: SFSymbol{

// let appleLogo: S = SFSymbols.applelogo

let symbol: S

var body: some View {
        Image(symbol: symbol)
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        .padding()
    }
    
}
```
